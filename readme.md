#Welcome to my Neighborhood By Rashad Cureton#

###Summary###

In this project I added a couple of my favorite Neighborhoods and places that I frequent throughout the year in NYC.

La Marina is the perfect place to visit in the summer if you like to enjoy the latin culture with great music and good food.

The Brooklyn Museum is great if you like art exhibits and new galleries. First Saturdays at the BK museum are filled tons of events.

The Freedom Tower is great if you want to visit a symbol of history for the city of New York and the United States.

Brooklyn Bridge is probably one of the most famous bridges in the world pictured in almost every movie filmed in New York.

Havana Central Is staple in Cuban culture if you're ever in Midtown or the Upper West Side don't hesitate to go eat some great food.

The Meatball Shop is one of my favorite restaurants, if you love great Hip-Hop music and any combination of meatballs please make your way here.

The Brooklyn Heights Promenade is great for a date, so if you like talking and taking in great scenery this is the place where you can build some magic.
